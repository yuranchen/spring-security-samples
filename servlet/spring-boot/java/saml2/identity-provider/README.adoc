= A Sample Identity Provider

This sample by default uses Docker to stand up two sample IdPs, each with one asserting party and multiple relying parties registered.
This allows you to explore different arrangements between multiple relying parties and asserting parties.

To ensure that there are no issues with sharing cookies between the Identity Provider and Service Provider applications, the application uses `nip.io` hostnames.
The first identity provider can be reached by navigating to `http://idp-one.7f000001.nip.io`.
The second identity provider can be reached by navigating to `http://idp-two.7f000001.nip.io`.

To change how the IdP is configured, you can go to the sibling `identity-provider` project and edit the following files:

* `one-relyingparties.php` - the list of relying parties that `idp-one` knows about
* `two-relyingparties.php` - the list of relying parties that `idp-two` knows about
